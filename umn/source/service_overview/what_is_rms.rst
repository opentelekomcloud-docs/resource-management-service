Access Methods
--------------

You can use either of the following methods to access RMS:

-  Management console

   The console is a web-based UI, where you can perform operations easily. Log in to the management console and choose **Resource Management** > **My Resources** in the upper right corner.

-  Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)

   Use this method if you are required to integrate RMS on the public cloud platform into a third-party system for secondary development. For detailed operations, see *Resource Management Service API Reference*.
